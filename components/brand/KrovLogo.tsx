/**
 * The one place the KROV mark is allowed to come from.
 *
 * The mark is a fixed brand asset: it is never redrawn in CSS, never set as
 * live text, never recoloured and never scaled non-uniformly. Everything this
 * component does is pick the correct official file for the surface it sits on
 * and give it an intrinsic size so it cannot be squashed by a flex parent.
 *
 * Files live in `public/logos/`. The `krov-*` files are whitespace-cropped
 * derivatives of the supplied originals — identical artwork, identical
 * proportions, just without the 1500×1500 empty canvas the exports carry (an
 * uncropped export renders the wordmark at roughly half the size of its own
 * layout slot). The untouched originals remain alongside them.
 *
 *   tone="light"  white artwork      → for void / ink / coal surfaces
 *   tone="dark"   black artwork      → for linen surfaces
 *   tone="brand"  black + KROV red   → for linen surfaces where the mark leads
 *   tone="original" pale + KROV red  → for dark surfaces where the mark leads
 *
 * `variant="lockup"` is the full composition with the ornament above the
 * wordmark. It carries a large embedded raster, so it is reserved for the one
 * or two places a full brand statement is warranted — never for chrome.
