/**
 * Verify an Onvo webhook request by comparing the X-Webhook-Secret header
 * to our ONVO_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var.
 *
 * IMPORTANT CAVEAT: Onvo's documentation (as of 2026) shows the header
 * containing the literal webhook secret (prefix: webhook_secret_...), NOT an
 * HMAC signature. This means:
 *   - Anyone who captures one webhook header sees the long-lived secret.
 *   - Replay protection is weak: a captured webhook can be replayed forever.
 *
 * Our route handler defends in depth by additionally verifying:
 *   1. The event references an order we created (metadata.orderId exists in DB)
 *   2. The payment_reference in DB matches the webhook's data.id
 *   3. The webhook amount matches the order total
 *
 * Even with all three, the security model is weaker than HMAC-based webhooks
 * (Stripe-style). Revisit if/when Onvo publishes an HMAC verification spec.
 *
 * Uses `timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing-attack character leakage during
 * the comparison itself.
